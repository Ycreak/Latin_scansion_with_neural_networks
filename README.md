## About
Welcome to the project for scanning Latin poetry with machine learning. The project consists of three parts: 

1. Creating data sets for machine learning tools
2. Training and testing an CRF on Latin poetry
3. Training and testing an LSTM on Latin poetry

## Requirements
The programs are written entirely in Python and need the following packages:

1. pandas
2. bs4
3. lxml
4. keras
5. tensorflow
6. sklearn_crfsuite
7. cltk
8. matplotlib
9. seaborn
10. configparser
11. progress

All dependencies are also listed in requirements.txt. In your Python environment, you can install all dependencies via pip using the following command:

```console 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Creating a data set

### Using Pedecerto

### Using Anceps

## Running the CRF Network

## Running the LSTM Network
