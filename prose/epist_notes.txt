adice nunc quod ista quamvis exigua sint
    unsual prosody for QUOD

what problem is there with this line?
    the hypothetical hexameter seems a bit reminiscent of Verg. Georgics 1.196
    et, quamvis igni exiguo, properata maderent.

elision between fifth and sixth feet is strange


ulla opera nostra facere naturam alimenta
    This sort of opposition between natura and (human) ars is very Ovidian, and the line is good even if two elisions is a lot, but it also seems quite Cicero inflected - again, if Seneca is thinking about Ovid he could be reflecting that in his rhythm, but you could also discard.

unum diversa coalescunt sed ne ad aliud
    I think a possibility here is that there is a half-line in... coalescunt.
    Perhaps this is something of a Senecan rewriting of a line like Vergil, Aeneid 2.716:
        hanc ex diuerso sedem ueniemus in unum.    

illius caeli aut ipsius arundinis umor
    I think this is an interesting candidate - although not quite syntactically complete (ros might be an instance of enjambment from a hypothetical double hexametre line), the line is good, has a poetical flavour, and Seneca introduces his sentence with aiunt, which may well be a kind of 'Alexandrian footnote' (flagging an instance of (poetic) intertextuality)        

id illum non malle quod illo melius est
