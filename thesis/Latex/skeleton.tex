\textit{Can a neural network learn to scan Hexameters?}\\

1. Approach using HMM
2. Approach using CRF
3. Approach using LSTM
4. Approach using ELECTRA

What is the effect of different genres and different authors?
  Better results when directly relevant? epic, love, story
  Time of authors? Iuvenal vs Virgil?
    normalise results. same corpus size ovid compared to same size virgil
    idea: cluster same length texts: agglomerative clustering: create tree from Kestemont

What is the effect of different word representations?
  Strings, hashes, syllable embeddings, char/syll/word embeddings
  Different context windows (5), dimensions (100-300), no mincount 
  fasttext (autovocab), glove, word2vec
    cluster these vectors using PCA: are clusters logial and relevant to our task? syntactical and semantical?

Qualitative research
  qualitative approach: why these mistakes? why does crf do this particular syllable wrongly?

\textit{How well do these networks generalise to other meters?}
Elegiac, Iambic trimeter, anapest, trochaic tetrameter, polymetrum, hendycasyllabi
