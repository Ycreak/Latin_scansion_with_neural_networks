elsision -> separate long from short
compare current string with next string?

never three short syllables
Aeneid, 1:12. "an" is short? but is long by "ti"
Aeneid, 1:203. "an" scanned completely wrong. for - sa - net
				2:506. for si ta net pri a mi

Syllabifier -> forsitan et priami -> for si ta net pri a mi

Syllabify a line, not a word
